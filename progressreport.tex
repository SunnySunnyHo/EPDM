This is just supposed to summarise the progress as progress is made.
It will probably be out of date most of the time.
Groups are currently:
\begin{enumerate}
\item (intro, presentation 1 and exercise 1) Sunny and Gavin
\item (presentation 2 and exercise 2) Jackie, Colin W and William
\item (presentation 3, exercise 3 and 4) Ben, Christian, Colin B, Craig, Georgiev and Christos
\end{enumerate}

Although everything appears to be complete in table \ref{table1}, work is continuing on some extra material to reinforce parts of the seminars.
