Note: This is, of course, approximate and just kind of what will actually be said.
Also, very much an early draft.

(First part depends somewhat on how previous group ends their thing)

So, now you have heard all about the full factorial design. It gives a good indicator of how various factors will influence the final design, and is, overall, a really good way of planning out a design!

Here is why it is almost always useless in practice.

SLIDE

Sure, if you are designing a product with only three factors, it's great. You only need to run 8 experiments, and you have all the information you need for a full factorial design.

SLIDE

Even with four factors, you only need to do 16 experiments. This would probably be acceptable, as, after all, you are getting some very good data which you can use to optimise the design of your products.

However, most of the time your product is likely to have considerably more factors than four. The increase in the number of runs you would have to perform would be exponential. Anyone who has had the misfortune of sitting through lectures relating to computational complexity will know that exponential growth is considered a very, very, bad thing.

Say you had eight factors...

SLIDE

That's a lot of experiments. 256 to be exact. Or say you had two more factors, ten. Not an unlikely scenario.

SLIDE

1024 experimental runs. That would take a while. Probably almost as long as it too me to make that table.

This is why we need what is known as a Fractional Factorial Design.

SLIDE

For a fractional factorial design you, as the name suggests, only perform a fraction of the experiments you would have to make for a full factorial design.

This can drastically reduce the number of experiments you will have to run, but it comes at a cost. Obviously less gathering of data will mean less data from which to extract information. The trick is to make sure you get as much information as possible from as few runs as possible.

The trick is making sure that you lose as little data as possible.

SLIDE

So, how do you make sure that you lose as little data as possible when doing less experiments? The trick lies in being smart in choosing what factors you want to test.

An example of how it could be done is shown here, where this table is reduced to...

SLIDE

...this table.

The way in which this is done is not as random as it may seem! This grid is carefully constructed to test as many things as possible in the available experiments.

Ideally, we would be able to test the difference made by all effects in respect to all other effects.

SLIDE

This is a list of all the combinations you would want to test if you had four factors. There are 15 combinations of change, plus the base case where everything stays constant.

Now lets use + to symbolise that these are all the same, and - to symbolise that they are not.

See it yet?

Moving the columns around, you can see that there are two columns for each combination.
This illustrates that as many combinations as possible have been tested during the available experiments.

Whether a fractional factorial design is sufficient or not will depend on the individual cases in which it is used. For any such model to be sufficient, you should at least have more runs than you have factors in your experiment, preferably at least double.

However, this method can only be used if the number of experimental runs you can perform is a power of 2. Sure, you can reduce the numbers of experiments to as few as you like, but it still has to be some power of two.

But what, I hear you ask, if I have an available number of experimental runs that is not a factor of two? What will I do with all those extra runs?

Fear not! This very problem was faced by the British government in the 40s, and two guys named Plackett and Burman solved it.

SLIDE

As long as your number of available runs is a multiple of four, and the factors is one less than this, you can use the Plackett-Burman Experiment Design. This is a standard design, you don't need to know exactly how this table is constructed.
However, if you spend a while looking at it (and I have), you will realise that every combination of signs between any two factors appears the same number of times. In this case, every combination appears three times.

At most this could be used for one factor less than the number of experimental runs. However, it would be advisable to use fewer factors and make them redundant, as this would give you greater degrees of freedom when estimating errors.

So, now the question becomes, "when should I use which design?"

If you have a small number of effects and wish to thoroughly investigate their effect on each other, you can use a Full Factorial experiment design.

If you have a large number of factors, and can make do with a little less resolution in your experiments, Fractional Factorial Designs are just what you need.

If you have loads of factors you want to take into account, and don't really care about two-factor interactions, then Plackett and Burman are your guys.


Got that? Good. Now it's time to present you with something completely new, something which, in reality, will be more useful than all of these designs most of the time.
The primary problem with what we have done so far is that it only accounts for two levels of each of the factors. What if you want to do it for, say, three factors?
If a full factorial design for eight factors would require 256 runs, just imagine how many runs eight factors with three levels would require! (Hint: It's 6561)
Sure, fractional factorial and P&B experimental designs use common sense to cut down the number of experiments needed, but in most "real life" situations this just isn't enough.

Where common sense just doesn't do the job, maths comes to the rescue.

SLIDE

Cue the wonders of Response Surface Methodology!

SLIDE

The basic principle behind Response Surface Methodology, or RSM as I will call it from now on, is to perform some experiments, and then extrapolate further assumed results from those observations.

The idea is to build an equation where the factors, and one or more polynomials of the factors, are assigned coefficients. This can be done with as many polynomials as are needed, but generally that isn't too many.
